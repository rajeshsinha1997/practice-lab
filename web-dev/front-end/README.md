# 🎨 Front-End Projects

This folder contains all my front-end development projects — built to sharpen my skills in UI/UX, JavaScript frameworks, responsive design, and client-side logic.

## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

- Semantic and accessible HTML5
- Modular and maintainable CSS architecture
- Responsive layouts with Flexbox
- UI animations using `@keyframes`, `transition`, and `animation` properties
- Reusable utility classes for animation timing, delays, and fill modes
- Consistent theming with Google Fonts and design tokens
- Button styling with gradients, hover/focus effects, and interactive feedback
- Visual layout techniques using floats and `position: absolute`
- Designing static interfaces with pixel-perfect alignment
- Creating interactive UI patterns purely with HTML and CSS (no JS)

## 🧪 Learning Goals

- Build beautiful and accessible UIs
- Practice responsive and mobile-first design principles
- Improve mastery of layout and positioning
- Explore transitions, micro-interactions, and page load animations
- Develop reusable design patterns and scalable CSS structure
- Gain confidence in using floats, absolute positioning, and z-index stacking when Flexbox/Grid aren't suitable
- Push visual polish by combining gradients, icons, and animations for brand-like interfaces
- Understand the limits of pure CSS and when to introduce JavaScript for richer interactions

# 📝 Notes

Each subfolder contains a standalone project with its own setup and `README.md` (where applicable). Feel free to explore and remix!
