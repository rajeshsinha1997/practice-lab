# 🖥️ Web Development Projects

This section of the Practice Lab contains all my web development projects — from frontend UI experiments to backend APIs and full-stack applications.

## 🎯 Goals

- Explore modern web frameworks and libraries
- Build real-world components and app layouts
- Practice API design, authentication, and deployment
- Sharpen frontend + backend integration skills
- Strengthen HTML/CSS fundamentals with real-world layouts
- Apply UI/UX principles with accessibility and polish in mind
- Create interactive and animated user experiences using only HTML and CSS
- Learn when to rely on core web tech vs. JavaScript-based enhancements
