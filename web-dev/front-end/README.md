# 🎨 Front-End Projects

This folder contains all my frontend development projects — built to sharpen my skills in UI/UX, JavaScript frameworks, responsive design, and client-side logic.

## 🧪 Learning Goals

- Build beautiful, accessible user interfaces
- Master layout systems (Flexbox, Grid)
- Practice responsive and mobile-first design
- Deepen understanding of component-driven architecture
- Optimize for performance and reusability

# 📝 Notes

Each subfolder contains a standalone project with its own setup and `README.md` (where applicable). Feel free to explore and remix!
